Question 1. What is Python? What are the ways to install Python in your PC?

Ans-> Python is a general purpose and object oriented programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991.
 It can be used for web apps, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc. 
 It supports or use modules and packages in it where package means a travel package which contains many facilities 
 in it like hotel room destination places to visit etc.

Ways to install python:
1. Anaconda (anaconda.com) -> It is free and open source distribution which contains many libraries and packages
 where we can write, modify and run code. we need not to download libraries individually again and again.

2. Python (python.org) -> From this website we can download python at once but it does not download all packages and libraries
 it only provides link to download that libraries whenever needed so again and again we have to download the libraries 
 from given link and hence it is long process.


Question 2. What are Code Environments? Types?

Ans. Code Environment is standalone environment to write, modify and run the Python code. 
 Each code environment has its own set of packages. Environments are independent: you can install different packages 
 or different versions of packages in different environments without interaction between them.

Types of Code Environment
1. Text Editors -> It is used to create and open text files. Some of the text editors are Sublime Text, Visual Studio and Atom.

2. Full IDEs -> Designed for python and provides features like execution and testing that helps programmers. 
   Some of the IDEs are PyCharm, Spyder and Vs Code.

3. Notebook Environments -> Input and Output is seen on one screen itself. One of the popular Notebook is Jupyter Notebook.
